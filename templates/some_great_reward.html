Tracks like “People Are People” brought the band mainstream success while others, such as “Blasphemous Rumours” and “Master and Servant,” showcased their willingness to challenge social and religious norms. Some Great Reward cemented Depeche Mode’s reputation as innovators of electronic music with substance and edge.
